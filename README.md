Hello Everyone!

#Task 1

<h5>This python script is a simple program that checks whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age and whether they have a Voter ID.</h5>

<h5>The script prompts the user to enter their age and check if they are 18 or older.  If they meet the age requirement, the script further asks if they have a Voter ID. Based on the input, it outputs whether the user can Vote.</h5>
